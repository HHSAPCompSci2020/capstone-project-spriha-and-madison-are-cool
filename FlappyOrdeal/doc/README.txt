Flappy Ordeal
Revision 5/22/2021
Maddison Tipett and Spriha Pandey

Ever heard of the indie game Flappy Bird? In our game things get harder, and you will face a Flappy Ordeal! The Flappy Bird has to flap up or dive down in an effort to fly in between two pipes, and it if it crashes into the pipes you lose! In this ordeal, the bird also gets hungry, and needs to eat food to maintain its stamina. Things get harder when some of the pipes start to move up and down, but no worries! The player may stumble upon some powers that will grant the bird full stamina for one game or the power to freeze  all moving obstacles.

When the program is launched, the user will see a dialog asking if they want to begin playing. Click Yes  to begin playing, Click No or close the dialog to exit the program.

Once the game starts, you will be able to see the image of the bird. You can move up or down by pressing the up or down arrow keys

The bird starts to lose its stamina as it flies. It also loses it stamina at faster rates if it bumps against the edges of the window. It gets 1 point  added to its score every time it flies between two pipes. If it flies into one of the pipes instead of between them, it loses the game. The score and stamina are visible at the top - left and top - right corners of the screen respectively.

Some of the pipes could be moving up or down by certain amounts, while some of them can have a fixed position.

During the game, you will see images of an apple. These represent the food you have to collect to gain stamina. The numbers (between 1 - 10) next to the images of the food represent the amount of stamina they will provide. If you don’t collect any food, you will eventually run out of stamina and lose the game.

If you lose the game, you will see a dialog asking if you want to play again. Click yes to play again. Click No  or close the dialog to exit the program.
